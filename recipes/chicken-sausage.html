    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This chili has always been great during football season--and the rest of the year! But I like to make it a little healthier by reducing the fat and sodium content. Sprinkle with red onion, cilantro or diced avocado (optional).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in spicy sauce</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in spicy sauce</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble ground beef and chicken sausage into a large stock pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour in chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Add onion, celery, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, chile peppers, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, ground pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt, ground pepper, and chili powder in necessary, after 2 hours. Ladle into bowls and top with baked tortilla chips to serve.</li>

    </ol>
